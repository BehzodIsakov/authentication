# About the repository
This repository is all about authentication, its importance, different types of authentication. As a frontend developer, it is our responsibility to build an app that is robust enough to protect important and private data and authentication is one vital part of it, especially at the age when stealing data from different apps and website are becoming prevalent. During my 2-year experience, I have mainly used JWT and session based auth. But I still feel like a junior when it comes to the authentication on the client part and have many blind spots. This is the reason why I wanted to create this repo. I want to dig a little deeper than where I am currently. Also I hope it helps other developers like me to learn something from it. If you find any bugs, mistakes, or want to contribute in terms of adding anything beneficial you can create PR and I will happily review and merge it as soos as I can.
